# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When naming a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`.

If a needed concept is absent from the glossary, reconsider whether the repo already uses another term; otherwise note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly.
